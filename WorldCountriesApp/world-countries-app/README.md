# World Countries Explorer App

A mobile application built with Ionic Angular that provides information about countries around the world using the REST Countries API. The app features three screens:

- **List of Countries**: Displays a list of all countries with their flags, names, and alpha3 codes. Users can tap on a country to view more details.
- **Country Details Screen**: Shows detailed information about a selected country, including its flag, name, capital, and population. Users can add the country to their favorites.
- **Favorites Screen**: Displays a list of favorited countries. Users can remove countries from the favorites list by swiping or delete all favorites at once.

Data is persistently stored using the Capacitor Preferences API, and the app includes interactive elements like toast notifications and swipe-to-delete functionality for managing favorites.
